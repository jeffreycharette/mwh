Qualification for the ballot in Florida requires filing personal financial information, some other paperwork, and either paying a fee or turning in at least 1,089 petitions signed by registered voters in the district. Mary is one of the very few candidates in our area who qualified by petition this year.</p>
		<p>Her campaign wants to thank everyone who signed a petition and also the volunteers who helped Mary with her effort. Mary personally collected the majority of the petitions. It was a lot of walking and a lot of work but also a great experience. Talking to people one on one offers an unparalleled opportunity to learn what is really on the voters' minds.</p>
		<p>Mary has received some notable endorsements. Her first endorsement came from the Palm Beach-Treasure Coast AFL-CIO. She has also received endorsements from the Florida AFL-CIO and Florida NOW (National Organization for Women) PAC. Mary wants to thank each of these organizations for giving her the opportunity to earn their support. She seeks to live up to the confidence they have shown in her and plans to join them in advocating on behalf of Florida's women and working people.</p>

		<h3>October 12, 2013</h3>
		<img src="assets/images/issues-for-sugar-free-politics.jpg" class="aligncenter" alt="">
		<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ometimes, the most important news is something that didn't happen. On October 12, 2013, the big news was what the Scott administration didn't do- they didn't exercise an option to purchase land from U. S. Sugar at a set price of $7,400 an acre. The state could have bought the full 153,200 acres available for $1.13 billion or it could have bought 46,800 acres for $346,000,000. Land currently being used for sugar cultivation must be purchased if there is to be any possibility of creating a flow way to take excess flows into Lake Okeechobee south to the Everglades. Until that happens, the excess water will continue to be sent east and west with disastrous consequences for the estuaries on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. The state no longer has an exclusive option or a set price, but it retains the option to purchase sugar lands "at market price" through 2020. The discouraging part of the story is not that the deal wasn't done. The discouraging part is that it appears not to have been seriously considered. Ernie Barnett, interim director of the South Florida Water Management District stated that "We are not in any discussions on that with the company."</p>
		<h3 class="short_headline"><span></span></h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p>We are not in any discussions on that with the company.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3 class="short_headline"><span></span></h3>
		<p>Environmental land purchases by the state have traditionally been financed by bonds secured by revenues from the real estate documentary stamp tax. Florida has significantly reduced its debt service cost in recent years by refinancing existing debt issues at the historically low rates that have been available. That burden should be reduced still further in 2013-14 as bonds from Preservation 2000 are paid off. The opportunity remains, it is the will that is lacking. Rick Scott actively campaigned against buying sugar lands when he ran for governor and can hardly be expected to support such purchases now.</p>

		<p>More importantly, Scott and most current Republicans generally prefer to avoid spending on government programs and public works. In their "business friendly" worldview, public expenditures are justified when they reduce costs or increase profits for businesses and automatically suspect otherwise. Business owners and companies seeking profits are large political donors. When favorable legislative treatment increases their profits, they are willing and able to donate even more to pliant politicians' campaigns. Once started, this process is self-reinforcing.</p>

		<p>Consider the Republican record under Rick Scott. When he took office, Governor Scott called for the elimination of corporate income taxes. He wanted to reduce the current 5.5% rate to 3%, then eliminate it entirely by 2018. This tax accounts for over $2 billion or around 9% of state tax revenues. Scott was not able to sell his plan, so he sought to reduce the taxes another way- by increasing the level of exemption from the first $5,000 of taxable income to $25,000. He persuaded the legislature and in 2012 he got the legislature to raise the exemption again to $50,000. The governor's office credits these two cuts for saving businesses (and reducing tax revenues) $56,000,000 a year. In another nod to business interests, the Republicans cut sales taxes for manufacturers at a cost of $140,000,000 a year.</p>

		<p>In budget circles, these kinds of measures are called tax expenditures. Exempting a particular class of individuals from a tax that others pay has the same budgetary impact as collecting the tax from everyone who is similarly situated and then spending some of the proceeds on the privileged class of taxpayers. That money is spent- it is no longer available for any other purpose.  Two years worth of just these two tax expenditures that benefited private businesses would have been more than enough to purchase the 46,800 acre portion of the sugar lands. Of course, since environmental bonds are usually paid off over 20 years, a small fraction of that money would have been adequate to fund the purchase. In the end, it is a simple budgetary choice- fund one thing and cut the other.</p>

		<p>Economists project that the state will be helped by an expected $845 million surplus in the 2014-2015 budget year. Rick Scott, however, wants to cut state taxes by $500 million. He is up for re-election in 2014. In the same vein, Senator Joe Negron, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has proposed cutting $230 million in auto registration fees. He attempted to pass similar legislation last year but tried to offset the tax expenditure by ending a tax break for the insurance industry. Each year the tax break saves Florida Blue $32.5 million and State Farm $25 million. The bill went nowhere. The prospects for the fee cut are much better this year because it is an election year and the projected surplus eliminates the need to raid the insurance company tax break. The giveback, if passed, would equal about half the increase that was enacted in response to the budget shortfall faced in 2009. A possible roadblock to the "tax cut" is Senator Negron's own expressed desire to increase state reserves by $500 million.</p>

		<p>Senator Negron says he wants to send the water south. But first he wants to support Scott's election year tax cut, including the partial refund for auto registrations, and he also wants to pump up reserves. Florida's car owners surely would appreciate getting half their money back. Insurance companies and manufacturers will also want to keep their tax breaks. The estuaries may have to wait.</p>
